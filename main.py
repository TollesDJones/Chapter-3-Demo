Random Range 
Returns an integer form a group of numbers starting at 0 up to but not including the number passed

Branching 
The if statement
Branching gives us the opportunity to execute or skip code based on a condition

for example:
if condition == "true"
    do this
    
Comparison Operators
== Equal to (contents)
is Equal to (Object) 
!= Not Equal to 
> Greater than
< Less Than 
>= Greater Than or Equal to 
<= Less than or Equal To

While loops allow the execution of a block of code continuously while the condition remains true 
A Sentinel value is to control when looping should start/stop

Loop structure
Priming Input: initializes just before reaching the loop structure
Check: check the logic that updates the sentinel value
Update: be sure sentinel value will change at some point to prevent an 'Infinite' loop

Infinite Loop:
A loop that can never terminates

Values can be conditions in Python, what does this mean?
If a value exists and does not contain a NULL, EMPTY, or 0 value it can be evaluated as true
Also See Example 1 in the 'Branching' section above

"""
# Example 1 Values as Conditions
# money = float(input("Any value that is not 0 will evaluate as 'True'\nEnter a numeric value to test..."))
#
# if money:
#     print("Money has evaluated to True")
# else:
#     print("Money has evaluated to False")


# Example 2 While loop
#Here is our Prming input
# money = float(input("Any value that is not 0, NONE, NULL, EMPTY will evaluate as 'True'\nEnter a numeric value to test...\n"))

'''
Intentional Infinite Loops

Sometimes you may want to create an intentional 'infinite' loop this is very rare but valid
Using 'break' and 'continue' allows you to define an exit condition inside the loop

'break': will break you out of the loop 
'continue': will jump you to the start of the loop

'''
# Example 1 (Intentional Infinite Loops)
# count = 0
#
# while True: #'True' is forever evaluated as 'True' creating an 'infinite' loop
#
#     count += 1
#
#     #End the loop when count reches 10
#     if count > 10:
#         break
#
#     #Skip 5
#     if count == 5:
#         continue #Once this statement is reached flow is passed back
#                  # to the beginning of the loop before 'print()' is executed
#     print(count)

meaning a decision can be made by evaluating a group of conditions

This 'and' That 
This 'or' That 
('Not' This) 'and' ('Not' That)
